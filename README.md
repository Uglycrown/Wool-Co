Shopify-Style E-Commerce Product Page
This is a responsive product page built with vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. It looks and works like a modern Shopify product page, but uses only basic web technologies-no frameworks or libraries.

Features
Image Gallery: Clickable, scrollable thumbnails update the main product image. Zoom on hover (desktop).

Product Variants: Choose color (swatches) and size (buttons). Your last selection is remembered.

Size Chart: Button opens a modal with a size chart.

Compare Colours: Button opens a modal to compare multiple color swatches.

Complementary Products: Horizontally scrollable section of related products, each with an "Add to Cart" button.

Product Bundle: Shows a bundle offer with combined pricing and an "Add Bundle to Cart" button.

Product Info Tabs: Switch between Description, Product Info, and Shipping Details.

Related Products: Grid of similar products with badges and color dots.

Responsive: Works on desktop, tablet, and mobile.

Accessible Modals: Close by button, ESC key, or clicking outside.
